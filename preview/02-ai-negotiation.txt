PROMPT: AI Negotiation Panel - Diplomacy Interface

UI mockup for "RiskyRag" - a historical strategy game where LLM agents (GPT-4, Claude, Llama) play Risk against humans. Unique twist: AI agents are given temporal RAG constraints, meaning if it's 1453 in-game, they can only reference history up to that date. This creates historically authentic gameplay and tests LLM strategic reasoning.

Show the diplomatic negotiation interface. Split-panel design:

Left panel (30% width): Stylized historical portrait of Sultan Mehmed II with modern UI overlay. Label reads "Ottoman Empire" with blue "GPT-4" AI badge. Green "Online/Active" status indicator. Small historical context text: "Siege of Constantinople, May 1453"

Center panel (40% width): Modern messaging interface with chat bubbles:
- Ottoman message (dark red bubble, left-aligned): "The walls of Constantinople will fall within days. Join me now, and Venice shall control the Adriatic without interference."
- Venice response (gold bubble, right-aligned): "Your confidence is noted, Sultan. What guarantees can you provide regarding trade routes?"
- Ottoman typing indicator with animated dots: "GPT-4 is thinking..."

Right panel (30% width): "Historical Knowledge" sidebar with header "Known Events (≤ May 1453)" showing:
- "Siege began April 6, 1453"
- "Mehmed II commands 80,000 troops"
- "Byzantine defense: ~7,000 soldiers"
- "Ottoman super-cannons breach walls"
With notation: "✓ Temporal RAG filter active - no future knowledge"

Bottom: Message input field "Your diplomatic message..." with send button, plus quick actions: "Propose Alliance", "Declare War", "Request Cease-Fire"

Design: Dark theme (#1a1f35), glass-morphism panels with subtle blur, warm gold and crimson accents, clean sans-serif typography, professional UI/UX. 4K resolution.
