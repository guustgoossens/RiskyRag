PROMPT: Post-Game Benchmark Results Dashboard

UI mockup for "RiskyRag" - a dual-purpose platform that's both an educational strategy game AND an LLM benchmarking tool. After each game, detailed analytics show how different AI models (GPT-4, Claude, Llama) performed strategically, how well they adhered to temporal constraints (knowledge cutoff dates), and their historical accuracy.

Show the post-game victory screen with comprehensive benchmark data:

Top section: Large golden trophy icon with confetti particle effects (subtle). Main text: "Victory!"
Subtitle: "Ottoman Empire (GPT-4) has achieved world domination"
Game duration: "47 turns • 52 minutes • May 1453 scenario"

Main dashboard divided into three sections:

**Left: Game Statistics** (card with icon)
- Total turns played: 47
- Territories conquered: 14/14
- Battles won: 23 (96% success rate)
- Diplomatic agreements: 7
- Treaties broken: 2

**Center: Player Performance Comparison** (bar chart visualization)
Horizontal bars showing territory control over time:
- Ottoman Empire (GPT-4): 100% - WINNER (deep red)
- Venice (Human Player): 0% - Eliminated Turn 34 (gold)
- Byzantine (Claude Sonnet): 0% - Eliminated Turn 28 (purple)
- Genoa (Llama 3.2): 0% - Eliminated Turn 19 (navy)
