A vertical 9:16 formal presidential portrait of Abraham Lincoln, 1863.
Seated three-quarter pose in carved wooden chair, hand resting on documents.
Wearing signature black broadcloth suit, white shirt with black bow tie.
Deeply lined face with characteristic beard, eyes showing profound weariness and resolve.
Warm lamplight from left creating Rembrandt-style dramatic shadows.
Background: deep void navy (#0F172A) with American flag partially visible, gold (#D4AF37) fringe catching light.
Period-appropriate photography-influenced realism but rendered as oil painting.
Subtle texture of canvas visible. Gilded frame border effect within image.
Color palette muted and dignified: blacks, navy, parchment highlights on face.
The Great Emancipator at the weight of his burden. Brady photograph gravitas.
No anachronisms. Portrait fit for a national museum.
